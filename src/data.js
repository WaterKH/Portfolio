This site allows for users to search through every cutscene available in the Kingdom Hearts series by using categories or by searching for dialogue. There is also login functionality through a couple different ways to allow for saving favourites, projects, etc. There is also Patreon integration to allow for expanded features for patrons. This project was a version 2 of a pre-existing solution that was hosted by the original creator in a Google Sheet.",

There were two sides to this project: the UE4 mod and the Seed Generator, which is hosted online as well as also available as a local client. I co-developed the UE4 integration with another person and fully wrote the seed generator. I've made the latter open source and am still reviewing updates and patches received.",

      "This project started out as a reverse engineering exercise for the game Kingdom Hearts Melody of Memory to allow players to create their own custom charts for the game, like a themed Guitar Hero. It blossomed into more of a Unity Asset Editor, where I broke their encryption/decryption methods to allow for any asset in the game to be editable. Also, this project encompasses creating mods that actively allow for editing functionality of the game at runtime to allow for randomizers and so much more.",

    description:
      "A Crowd Controller targeting Kingdom Hearts II utilizing the Crowd Control framework. This project originally stemmed from a fully self-sufficient ecosystem that I created that integrated with Twitch to allow for users to watch a streamer and earn tokens to then spend on a hosted website that would connect to the client's instance of the game and alter the state at runtime. This has since been migrated to use the Crowd Control ecosystem, which allows for easy accessibility through their platform.",

      "I got into Cryptography back in Highschool when I started playing this game called Do Not Believe His Lies. Through this, I was exposed to the joys of logic puzzles and cryptography. This has led me to look for these kinds of puzzles as much as I can, which brought me to Call of Duty Zombies. This repository essentially holds my early projects where I explored different Cryptanalysis tools and ideas.",
